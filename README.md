# pygame-paint
A Paint Program made using [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/tree/main) and [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui)  

# usage
Well if it isn't obvious enough just run paint.py...\

# features
Basic paint stuff really like opening files, creating new canvases, saving to a location on your pc etc.\
Has 3 themes!!\
Which are default, light and dark\
THE BUCKET TOOL IS NOT ADDED AT THE MOMENT PRESSING THE BUTTON WILL CRASH THE PROGRAM\
Undo and Redo work but, you have to reclick on the canvas window to refocus... I'm gonna try and improve this\
You can also use Ctrl+Z to undo and Ctrl+Shift+Z to redo\
